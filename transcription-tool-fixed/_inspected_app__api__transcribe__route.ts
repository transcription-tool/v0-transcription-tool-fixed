Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani ابن حجر العسقلاني, in his monumental work Fath al-Bari فتح الباري, provides extensive commentary on this hadith. Similarly, Imam Qurtubi الإمام القرطبي in his tafsir, and Qadi Iyyad القاضي عياض in his Shifa الشفاء, have all referenced this hadith extensively.

The great scholar Mulla Ali Qari ملا علي قاري mentions in his Mirqat al-Mafatih مرقاة المفاتيح that this hadith is considered "Umm as-Sunnah" أم السنة - the mother of the Sunnah - because it encompasses the entire religion.

Shah Wali Ullah الشاه ولي الله of Delhi, in his Hujjat Allah al-Baligha حجة الله البالغة, explains that this hadith represents the three dimensions of human spiritual development.`,

"While we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه وسلم, peace be upon him, one day, a man appeared before us whose clothes were exceedingly white and whose hair was exceedingly black. No signs of travel were to be seen on him, and none of us knew him. He sat down facing the Prophet, peace be upon him, rested his knees against his knees, and placed his palms on his thighs."

بينما نحن عند رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم ذات يوم إذ طلع علينا رجل شديد بياض الثياب شديد سواد الشعر لا يرى عليه أثر السفر ولا يعرفه منا أحد فجلس إلى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فأسند ركبتيه إلى ركبتيه ووضع كفيه على فخذيه

Now, this description is very important. Ibn Mulaqqin ابن الملقن explains that this positioning - sitting thigh to thigh, knees against knees - shows the proper etiquette of seeking knowledge. It demonstrates closeness, attention, and respect.

The scholars mention that the description of "exceedingly white clothes" and "exceedingly black hair" indicates perfection in appearance, which befits an angel appearing in human form.`,

          content: `The man asked: "O Muhammad يا محمد, tell me about Islam الإسلام."

قال يا محمد أخبرني عن الإسلام

The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, peace be upon him, replied: "Islam is to testify that there is no god but Allah لا إله إلا الله and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah محمد رسول الله, to perform the prayers الصلاة, to pay the zakat الزكاة, to fast in Ramadan صوم رمضان, and to make the pilgrimage to the House الحج if you are able to do so."

الإسلام أن تشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمداً رسول الله وتقيم الصلاة وتؤتي الزكاة وتصوم رمضان وتحج البيت إن استطعت إليه سبيلاً

Mulla Ali Qari ملا علي قاري explains that these five pillars أركان الإسلام الخمسة represent the external, physical aspects of the religion. They are the foundation upon which the spiritual edifice is built.

Shah Wali Ullah الشاه ولي الله notes that each pillar serves a specific purpose in purifying different aspects of human nature - the tongue (shahada), the body (prayer), wealth (zakat), desires (fasting), and the ego (hajj).`,

          content: `When we examine the five pillars in detail, we see the wisdom that the classical scholars have extracted from them.

Ibn Hajar ابن حجر explains that the Shahada الشهادة is placed first because it is the foundation of all other acts. Without proper belief, no action can be considered truly Islamic.

Regarding prayer الصلاة, Imam Qurtubi القرطبي mentions that it was described as "establish prayer" أقيموا الصلاة rather than just "pray" because establishment implies perfection in all its conditions, pillars, and etiquettes.

The Quran states: وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ "And establish prayer and give zakat" (Quran 2:43).

For zakat الزكاة, the scholars explain that it purifies both the wealth and the soul. Ibn Mulaqqin ابن الملقن notes that zakat is not merely charity, but a right of the poor upon the wealthy.

Fasting in Ramadan صيام رمضان, according to Qadi Iyyad القاضي عياض, teaches self-control and develops consciousness of Allah (taqwa التقوى).

The pilgrimage الحج, as explained by various scholars, represents the ultimate act of submission, where all external distinctions are removed and believers stand equal before their Creator.`,

The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: "It is to believe in Allah الله, His angels الملائكة, His books الكتب, His messengers الرسل, the Last Day اليوم الآخر, and to believe in divine destiny القدر, both the good and the evil thereof."

الإيمان أن تؤمن بالله وملائكته وكتبه ورسله واليوم الآخر وتؤمن بالقدر خيره وشره

This represents the six articles of faith أركان الإيمان الستة. Notice how it progresses from belief in Allah, then to His creation (angels), His revelation (books), His messengers, the unseen future (Last Day), and finally to His decree (qadar).

Shah Wali Ullah الشاه ولي الله explains that these six articles represent the complete worldview of a Muslim, encompassing the seen and unseen, the past, present, and future.

Ibn Hajar ابن حجر notes that belief in divine destiny القدر is mentioned last because it is often the most challenging for human reason to fully comprehend.`,

          content: `The last article of faith - belief in divine destiny القدر - requires careful explanation. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said we must believe in "the good and the evil thereof" خيره وشره.

This has been a subject of extensive scholarly discussion. Imam Qurtubi القرطبي explains that this doesn't mean that evil actions are good in themselves, but rather that Allah's decree encompasses all things, and even apparent evil may contain hidden wisdom.

Mulla Ali Qari ملا علي قاري emphasizes that we must maintain the balance between affirming Allah's absolute sovereignty and human responsibility for their actions.

The great scholar Ibn Hajar ابن حجر mentions that the proper understanding is that Allah has knowledge of all things, has written all things, wills all things to occur according to His wisdom, and creates all things - yet humans have real choices within this framework.

Shah Wali Ullah الشاه ولي الله explains that this belief brings peace to the heart, as one realizes that everything happens according to divine wisdom, even if we cannot perceive it.`,

قال فأخبرني عن الإحسان

The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: "It is to worship Allah as if you are seeing Him أن تعبد الله كأنك تراه, for though you cannot see Him, He, verily, sees you فإنه يراك."

الإحسان أن تعبد الله كأنك تراه فإن لم تكن تراه فإنه يراك

This represents the pinnacle of spiritual development. Qadi Iyyad القاضي عياض explains that Ihsan has two levels:

1. The higher level (المقام الأعلى): to worship Allah as if you see Him - this is the station of mushahada المشاهدة (witnessing)
2. The lower level (المقام الأدنى): if you cannot achieve that, then remember that He sees you - this is the station of muraqaba المراقبة (watchfulness)

Ibn Mulaqqin ابن الملقن notes that both levels require complete consciousness of Allah's presence, but the first is based on love and longing, while the second is based on awe and reverence.

Mulla Ali Qari ملا علي قاري explains that this is not just about ritual worship, but about excellence in all aspects of life, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: "Indeed, Allah has prescribed excellence الإحسان in all things" (Muslim).`,

They replied: "Allah and His Messenger know best الله ورسوله أعلم."

He said: "That was Jibril جبريل (Gabriel). He came to teach you your religion جاء يعلمكم دينكم."

ذاك جبريل أتاكم يعلمكم دينكم

The scholars have discussed extensively why Jibreel عليه السلام chose this particular method of teaching:

Ibn Hajar ابن حجر mentions that by appearing as a stranger and asking questions, Jibreel ensured that the companions would remember both the questions and answers perfectly.

Qadi Iyyad القاضي عياض explains that the physical positioning - sitting thigh to thigh فخذ إلى فخذ - demonstrates the proper etiquette between student and teacher.

Imam Qurtubi الإمام القرطبي notes that this method shows that asking questions is not a sign of ignorance, but rather a means of learning and teaching others.

Shah Wali Ullah الشاه ولي الله emphasizes that this hadith contains the entire religion in summary form - the external (Islam), the internal (Iman), and the spiritual (Ihsan).

The positioning described - hands on thighs يديه على فخذيه - according to Ibn Mulaqqin ابن الملقن, shows complete attention, respect, and readiness to receive knowledge.`,
        },
        {
          timestamp: "65:20",
          title: "Question and Answer Session",
          content: `Now we'll open the floor for questions about today's comprehensive study of this fundamental hadith.

Question 1: "Shaykh, you mentioned the scholarly opinions on sitting thigh to thigh. Can you elaborate on what this means practically for students of knowledge today?"

Answer: Excellent question, barakallahu feeki. The phrase "thigh to thigh" فخذ إلى فخذ, as explained by Ibn Hajar ابن حجر and other scholars, doesn't necessarily mean physical contact, but rather sitting very close, face to face, showing complete attention and respect. In our context today, this means when we're learning, we should:

1. Give our full attention to the teacher
2. Sit properly and respectfully  
3. Maintain eye contact and engagement
4. Show that we value the knowledge being shared

The key principle, as Qadi Iyyad القاضي عياض mentions, is demonstrating that you consider the knowledge precious and the teacher worthy of respect.

Question 2: "You quoted from Surah An-Nur about the names of the Prophet. Can you explain this connection more?"

Answer: SubhanAllah, this is a beautiful connection. When discussing the etiquette of addressing the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, the beginning of verse 63 of Surah An-Nur states: لَا تَجْعَلُوا دُعَاءَ الرَّسُولِ بَيْنَكُمْ كَدُعَاءِ بَعْضِكُمْ بَعْضًا "Do not make the calling of the Messenger among you as the calling of one of you to another."

This teaches us that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم should be addressed with special reverence and respect, not casually like we address each other. Even Jibreel عليه السلام, despite his high status, addressed him respectfully as "O Muhammad" يا محمد.

Question 3: "What is the practical difference between the two levels of Ihsan that you mentioned?"

Answer: The two levels, as explained by the classical scholars, represent different spiritual stations:

The higher level - "worship Allah as if you see Him" - is the station of mushahada المشاهدة. This is when the worshipper is so conscious of Allah's presence that it's as if they can see Him. This level is characterized by love, longing, and complete absorption in worship.

The lower level - "if you cannot see Him, then He sees you" - is the station of muraqaba المراقبة. This is consciousness based on knowing that Allah is watching. It's characterized by awe, reverence, and careful attention to one's actions.

Both are excellent levels, and most of us fluctuate between them depending on our spiritual state and the strength of our connection at any given moment.

Question 4: "How do the scholars reconcile human free will with divine predestination, especially given the different opinions you mentioned?"

Answer: This is one of the most profound questions in Islamic theology. The balanced approach of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah, as articulated by scholars like Ibn Hajar ابن حجر and Shah Wali Ullah الشاه ولي الله, maintains that:

1. Allah has complete knowledge of all things (علم الله الشامل)
2. Allah has written all things in the Preserved Tablet (اللوح المحفوظ)
3. Nothing occurs except by Allah's will and permission (مشيئة الله وإذنه)
4. Allah creates all actions (الله خالق كل شيء)

Yet simultaneously:
1. Humans have real choices and are responsible for their actions
2. We experience genuine decision-making
3. We are justly rewarded or punished based on our choices

The key is understanding that Allah's knowledge doesn't force our choices - rather, His knowledge encompasses all possibilities, and our free choices occur within His encompassing knowledge and wisdom.

Question 5: "Can you explain more about why this hadith is called 'Umm as-Sunnah' - the mother of the Sunnah?"

Answer: Mulla Ali Qari ملا علي قاري and other scholars call this hadith "Umm as-Sunnah" أم السنة because it contains the essence of the entire religion in a comprehensive yet concise manner.

Just as a mother gives birth to and nurtures her children, this hadith gives birth to and encompasses all other religious teachings:

- Islam الإسلام covers all external actions and obligations
- Iman الإيمان covers all beliefs and internal states  
- Ihsan الإحسان covers the spiritual dimension and excellence in worship

Every other hadith, every fiqh ruling, every aspect of Islamic spirituality can be traced back to one of these three categories. That's why the scholars consider it the "mother" - the source from which all other religious knowledge flows.

Additionally, the method of teaching demonstrated here - through questions and answers - became a model for Islamic education throughout history.

Jazakumullahu khayran for these thoughtful questions. May Allah increase us all in beneficial knowledge and righteous action. والله أعلم - And Allah knows best.`,
